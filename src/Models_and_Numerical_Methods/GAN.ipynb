    "First goal is to build up a generator *G* that gives in output some images starting from noise.\n",

    "**NOTE**: *G* never sees real images but only learn how to beat *D*. On the other hand, *D* is trained on both datasets (real and fake).\n",
    "\n",
    "A GAN is very hard to train, requires GPU and a lot of time... so we'll try our best.\n",
    "We're going to work with face images, which need to be resized to 64x64.\n",
    "All images have three channels: red, green and blue.\n",
    "The package *vision* in PyTorch is going to help us with these operations.\n",

    "*G* is our generator.\n",

    "*D* wants to maximize its probability to guess right, while *G* wants to minimize it.\n",
